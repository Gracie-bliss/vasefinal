Summary: I went with the 2nd strategy because it was the simplest and would not cause people to be waiting around. With the sign they wouldn't have to try to enter the room there could just be a flag present. The disadvantage would be that the guest could go in any order, there was no structure to how they're lining up.

Justification:This was the most efficient way as it was simple and only required the threads to communicate through a flag.

Experimentation: I tested a smaller number of threads first and then a larger one until I reached 10.
